## What is this and why should i use it?

This project is a way for me to start a new laravel project on my machine without having anything installed besides docker localy.
No need for me to install php, composer or anything else.

I have only used this on my mac, if anyone tries it on another OS, tell me how it went.

## Dependencies

You need to have docker installed on your system.
If you don't have it already, check it out: [www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)

## Usage

`./setup.bash your_project_name`
